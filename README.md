# Rise Vision Common E2E Module ![Build Status]()

## Introduction

This is node module which contains common code for our Rise Vision platform E2E tests. This code needs to be run by protractor so it is a nice fit for
complementing [widget-tester](https://github.com/Rise-Vision/widget-tester).

Project Name works in conjunction with [Rise Vision](http://www.risevision.com), the [digital signage management application](http://rva.risevision.com/) that runs on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com).

At this time Chrome is the only browser that this project and Rise Vision supports.
